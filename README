Version1.3- requirements:
I need a proper reset buton on this. - or do I? ..Not if I fix the following:-
All the editing facilities of a normal system as well. 
Save and clear are running too slowly for some reason. 
A current typing position cursor is imprtant to. 
Do I make one or work on getting the thing to work correctly in the first place?
I want to stop the multigestures mucking up the use, sliding off out of it pointlessly is very irritating.
All, the key tops lose the letters if I miss key.
Resttting / wiping the internally saved files needs a full re-install.
The buffer size for Read is not expanding....
Update - Buffer not needed at all !

Still gets very slow whith large amounts of text.
Email has NO paragraphs at all.
